	abstract = {This volume brings together international perspectives on key concepts, themes, theories, and practices that are defining peace psychology at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The authors share with their international colleagues a broad vision of peace psychology, covering a wide range of topics such as ethnic conflict, family violence, hate crimes, militarism, conflict management, social justice, nonviolent approaches to peace, and peace education. In addition to providing a useful resource that integrates current research and practice for scholars and practitioners, the authors wanted the book to be accessible enough to introduce a new generation of students, both graduate and upper-division undergraduate, to the field. The book topics are organized according to four main currents in peace psychology: (1) violence, (2) social inequalities, (3) peacemaking, and (4) the pursuit of social justice.
