	abstract = {The GW approximation in electronic structure theory has become a widespread tool for predicting electronic excitations in chemical compounds and materials. In the realm of theoretical spectroscopy, the GW method provides access to charged excitations as measured in direct or inverse photoemission spectroscopy. The number of GW calculations in the past two decades has exploded with increased computing power and modern codes. The success of GW can be attributed to many factors: favorable scaling with respect to system size, a formal interpretation for charged excitation energies, the importance of dynamical screening in real systems, and its practical combination with other theories. In this review, we provide an overview of these formal and practical considerations. We expand, in detail, on the choices presented to the scientist performing GW calculations for the first time. We also give an introduction to the many-body theory behind GW, a review of modern applications like molecules and surfaces, and a perspective on methods which go beyond conventional GW calculations. This review addresses chemists, physicists and material scientists with an interest in theoretical spectroscopy. It is intended for newcomers to GW calculations but can also serve as an alternative perspective for experts and an up-to-date source of computational techniques.},

	abstract = {The GW-technology corrects the Kohn–Sham (KS) single particle energies and single particle states for artifacts of the exchange-correlation (XC) functional of the underlying density functional theory (DFT) calculation. We present the formalism and implementation of GW adapted for standard quantum chemistry packages. Our implementation is tested using a typical set of molecules. We find that already after the first iteration of the self-consistency cycle, G0W0, the deviations of quasi-particle energies from experimental ionization potentials and electron affinities can be reduced by an order of magnitude against those of KS-DFT using GGA or hybrid functionals. Also, we confirm that even on this level of approximation there is a considerably diminished dependency of the G0W0-results on the XC-functional of the underlying DFT.},
