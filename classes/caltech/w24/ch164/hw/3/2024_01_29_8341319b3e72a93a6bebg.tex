\begin{enumerate}
  \item (from Chandler 3.22)
\end{enumerate}

(a) (14 pts.) Consider a region within a fluid described by the van der Waals equation

$$
\beta p=\frac{\rho}{1-b \rho}-\beta a \rho^{2}
$$

where $\rho=\langle N\rangle / V$. The volume of the region is $L^{3}$. Due to the spontaneous fluctuations in the system, the instantaneous value of the density in that region can differ from its average by an amount $\delta \rho$. Determine, as a function of $\beta, \rho, a, b$, and $L^{3}$, the typical relative size of these fluctuations; that is, evaluate $\left\langle(\delta \rho)^{2}\right\rangle^{1 / 2} / \rho$. Demonstrate that when one considers observations of a macroscopic system (i.e., the size of the region becomes macroscopic, $L^{3} \rightarrow \infty$ ) the relative fluctuations become negligible.
\subsection{}
We have a fixed temperature $\beta = 1/kT$ and a fixed volume $V=L^3$. The relevant thermo dynamic potential for this problem is going to be the Helmholtz free energy. The differential of the Helmholtz free energy is given by:
\begin{equation}
  dF=-SdT-pdV+\mu dN
\end{equation}
Taking into account that the volume and the temperature are fixed, it becomes:

(b) (9 pts.) A fluid is at its "critical point" when

$$
\left(\frac{\partial \beta p}{\partial \rho}\right)_{\beta}=\left(\frac{\partial^{2} \beta p}{\partial \rho^{2}}\right)_{\beta}=0
$$

Determine the critical point density and temperature for a fluid obeying the van der Waals equation. That is compute $\beta_{c}$ and $\rho_{c}$ as a function of $a$ and $b$.

(c) (9 pts.) Focus attention on the subvolume of size $L^{3}$ in the fluid. Suppose $L^{3}$ is 100 times the space filling volume of a molecule - that is, $L^{3} \approx 100 b$. For this region in the fluid, compute the relative size of the density fluctuations when $\rho=\rho_{c}$, and the temperature is $10 \%$ above the critical temperature. Repeat this calculation for temperatures $0.1 \%$ and $0.001 \%$ from the critical temperature.

(d) (8 pts.) Light that we can observe with our eyes has wavelengths of order of $1000 \AA$. Fluctuations in density cause changes in the index of refraction, and those changes produce scattering of light. Therefore, if a region of fluid $1000 \AA$ across contains significant density fluctuations, we will visually observe these fluctuations. On the basis of the type of calculation performed in part (b), determine how close to the critical point a system must be before critical fluctuations become optically observable (that is, when the quantity $\left\langle(\delta \rho)^{2}\right\rangle^{1 / 2} / \rho$ is of order one). The phenomenon of long wavelength density fluctuations in a fluid approaching the critical point is known as opalescence. (Note: You will need to estimate the size of $b$, and to do this you should note that the typical diameter of a small molecule is around $5 \AA$ ).
\section{}
\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item (i) (15 points) Consider a perfect crystal originally comprised of $N$ molecules on an equal number of lattice sites. The creation of vacancies in the lattice (or equivalently adding "surface" sites) is a thermally activated process with Boltzmann factor, $e^{-w / k T}$ where $w$ is the energy required to bring each of the molecules to the surface.
\end{enumerate}

If $n$ of these $N$ molecules move to the surface and leave $n$ vacant lattice sites, show that the partition function is well approximated by

$$
Q(N, T)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(N+n) !}{n ! N !} e^{-n w / k T}
$$

Considering the thermodynamic limit and that $w$ is several $k T$, find the maximal term in the above sum to show that

$$
\frac{n}{N+n}=e^{-w / k T}
$$
\subsection{}
Each vacancy might be accompanied by an energy $\omega$ (the energy of a surface site) and the total energy of the microstate would, therefore, be $n\times \omega$.
As usual the Boltzmann factor is $e^{-\beta E}$, where $\beta=1/kT$ and $E=n\omega$.
Considering how canonical ensemble partition function is defined, we have:
\begin{equation}
  Q(N,T)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\Omega (N,n)e^{-\beta E}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega (N,n)$ is the number of microstates with $N$ molecules and $n$ vacancies.
(ii) (15 pts.) Evaluate the above full partition function and then obtain $\langle n\rangle$ by suitable differentiation of $\log Q$. (Hint: Think of $Q(N, V, T)$ as a power series $Q(N, V, T)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} z^{n}$.) Are the results for $\langle n\rangle$ from the maximum term and the full partition function the same?
\section{}
\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item (30 pts.) Show that the entropy for the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac gas can be written in the form
\end{enumerate}

$$
S=-k \sum_{\alpha=1}^{\infty}\left[\left\langle n_{\alpha}\right\rangle \ln \left\langle n_{\alpha}\right\rangle \mp\left(1 \pm\left\langle n_{\alpha}\right\rangle\right) \ln \left(1 \pm\left\langle n_{\alpha}\right\rangle\right)\right]
$$

where $\left\langle n_{\alpha}\right\rangle$ is the average occupation number for state $\alpha$.
\subsection{}
The Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions are given by:
\begin{equation}
  \left\langle n_{\alpha}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{e^{\beta\left(\epsilon_{\alpha}-\mu\right)}\mp 1}
\end{equation}
where the upper sign is for Bose-Einstein and the lower sign is for Fermi-Dirac.
