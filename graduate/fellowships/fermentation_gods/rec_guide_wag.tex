\section{Speech Therapy}
Back in Ch 121a in the spring, I notified you that I had to miss a class due to speech therapy. I imagine that this isn't your typical request for missing class. Given that speech is obviously a prerequisite for communicating any sort of science, how do you feel that I am not satisfied and want to continue working on this skill through therapy?
\section{Content of Voice Coding}
I don't think that I will be reinventing the wheel in Ch 121. However, I believe that I have been able to show that dictation enables me to produce science of a high quality. How does this make you feel about my chances of succeeding in a chemical research career?
