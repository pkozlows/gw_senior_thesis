## Additional Note or Comment

- **Name of health condition/disability**: Leukemia; Stroke
- **First diagnosed?** (if known): 1/21; 3/21
- **Describe the impact of your disability.**: I finished my chemotherapy in May, but I am told that my immune system will be compromised for at least ~6 months after. I use an assistive device like a walker in order to walk. My fine motor function is impaired for things like typing, handwriting, and cooking. My speech is functional but impaired (I have spastic dysarthria).
- **How and when have you used accommodations previously?**: I have been living on the Caltech campus for the past year, where I have had a single ADA-compliant room with my own bathroom. I also have meals delivered to my room. I have been approved to use audio recordings for all academic meetings (Glean). I have also been getting extensions for when I am not feeling well and I get extended time on my exams, which are all take-home. Caltech has a particularly strict academic honor code policy, but I have been approved to use ChatGPT as an accommodation to act kind of like a personal tutor.
- **Do you use specialized equipment, including hardware/software? If yes, describe**: I use dictation to control my computer, which uses software called Talon Voice (free). I also use GitHub Copilot to help me with my programming, which is free if you are able to prove to the company that you are a college student. I use ChatGPT for the reasons mentioned before (free).
- **Please briefly list your anticipated accommodation needs**: As for the physical accommodations, I will need an ADA-compliant single room with a private bathroom. I will also need meals delivered to my room. We have to figure out how to make this work reliably during the winter time, which I have not been exposed to yet. I expect similar academic accommodations to what I got at Caltech including the use of ChatGPT whenever collaboration is allowed. Also, I want to be put in contact with a primary care physician on campus since I will need regular blood draws and referrals to specialists, such as a rehabilitation doctor.
