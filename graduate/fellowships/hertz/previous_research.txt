"Spin-Phonon Coupling in Transition Metal Complexes." Jun-Nov 2019
This project sparked a desire in theoretical chemistry. My advisor, Professor Hadt, would say "let's do some science," and this got me excited like a little kid with a new toy. I worked hard on this computational project throughout the summer and continued working on it during the difficult academic year at Caltech. My work was eventually included in a Journal of Chemical Physics publication.

"Elucidating Catalysis with the "Gold Standard" of Quantum Chemistry." Jun 2020 - Mar 2021
Research was difficult for everyone during the pandemic. However, I managed to be diligent in this quantum chemistry study of surface science. My work on the project continued throughout the school year, as I improved my virtual presentation for a speaking competition and wrote a publication in the Caltech Undergraduate Research Journal to describe my findings.
