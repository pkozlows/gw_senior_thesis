	abstract = {The GW approximation is well-known for the calculation of high-quality ionization potentials and electron affinities in solids and molecules. Recently, it has been identified that the density matrix that is obtained from the contraction of the GW Green’s function allows one to include Feynman diagrams that are significant for the ionization potentials. However, the Green’s function contains much more information than the mere quasi-particle energies. Here, we test and assess the quality of this so-called linearized GW density matrix for several molecular properties. First of all, we extend the original formulation to perform the linearization starting from any self-consistent mean-field approximation, and not only from Hartree–Fock. We then demonstrate the reliability and the stability of the linearized GW density matrix to evaluate the total energy out of a non-self-consistent GW calculation. Based on a comprehensive benchmark of 34 molecules, we compare the quality of the electronic density, Hartree energy, exchange energy, and the Fock operator expectation values against other well-established techniques. In particular, we show that the obtained linearized GW densities markedly differ from those calculated within the widespread quasi-particle self-consistent GW approximation.},

	abstract = {The aim of this graduate-level textbook is to present and explain, at other than a superficial level, modem ab initio approaches to the calculation of the electronic structure and properties of molecules. The first three chapters contain introductory material culminating in a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation.The remaining four chapters describe a variety of more sophisticated approaches, which improve upon this approximation.Among the highlights of the seven chapters are (1) a review of the mathematics (mostly matrix algebra) required for the rest of the book, (2) an introduction to the basic techniques, ideas, and notations of quantum chemistry, (3) a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) a treatment of configuration interaction (Cl) and approaches incorporating electron correlation, (5) a description of the independent electron pair approximation and a variety of more sophisticated approaches that incorporate coupling between pairs, (6) a consideration of the perturbative approach to the calculation of the correlation energy of many-electron systems and (7) a brief introduction to the use of the one-particle many-body Green\&\#39;s function in quantum chemistry.Over 150 exercises, designed to help the reader acquire a working knowledge of the material, are embedded in the text. The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student\&\#39;s appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},

We find that already after the first iteration of the self-consistency cycle, G0W0, the deviations of quasi-particle energies from experimental ionization potentials and electron affinities can be reduced by an order of magnitude against those of KS-DFT using GGA or hybrid functionals. Also, we confirm that even on this level of approximation there is a considerably diminished dependency of the G0W0-results on the XC-functional of the underlying DFT.},

	abstract = {The linearized GW density matrix (γGW) is an efficient method to improve the static portion of the self-energy compared to that of ordinary perturbative GW while keeping the single-shot simplicity of the calculation. Previous work has shown that γGW gives an improved Fock operator and total energy components that approach the self-consistent GW quality. Here, we test γGW for dimer dissociation for the first time by studying N2, LiH, and Be2. We also calculate a set of self-consistent GW results in identical basis sets for a direct and consistent comparison. γGW approaches self-consistent GW total energies for a starting point based on a high amount of exact exchange. We also compare the accuracy of different total energy functionals, which differ when evaluated with a non-self-consistent density or density matrix. While the errors in total energies among different functionals and starting points are small, the individual energy components show noticeable errors when compared to reference data. The energy component errors of γGW are smaller than functionals of the density and we suggest that the linearized GW density matrix is a route to improving total energy evaluations in the adiabatic connection framework.},

	abstract = {We use the GW100 benchmark set to systematically judge the quality of several perturbation theories against high-level quantum chemistry methods. First of all, we revisit the reference CCSD(T) ionization potentials for this popular benchmark set and establish a revised set of CCSD(T) results. Then, for all of these 100 molecules, we calculate the HOMO energy within second- and third-order perturbation theory (PT2 and PT3), and \$GW\$ as post Hartree-Fock methods. \$GW\$ is by far the most accurate approximation for the ionization potential. Going beyond \$GW\$ by adding more diagrams is a tedious and dangerous activity: We tried to complement \$GW\$ with second-order exchange (SOX), with second-order screened exchange (SOSEX), with interacting electron-hole pairs (\$W\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{TDHF\}\$), and with a \$GW\$ density-matrix (\${\textbackslash}gamma{\textasciicircum}\{GW\}\$). Only the \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textasciicircum}\{GW\}\$ result has a positive impact. Finally using an improved hybrid functional for the non-interacting Green's function, considering it as a cheap way to approximate self-consistency, the accuracy of the simplest \$GW\$ approximation improves even more. We conclude that \$GW\$ is a miracle: The neglected diagrams compensate almost perfectly, which makes \$GW\$ both accurate and fast.},
