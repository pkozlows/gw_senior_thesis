\section{Perovskites}
\subsection{Structure}
The ideal perovskite stucture is ABO3, where A is a large cation, B is a smaller cation, and O is an oxygen anion. The B cation is typically a transition metal, and the A cation is typically an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal. The structure is face-centered cubic, with the B cation at the center of the cube, the A cation at the corners of the cube, and the O anion at the center of each face of the cube. The structure is shown in Figure 1.

\subsection{Applications}
Perovskites have shown potential as efficient heterogeneous catalysts that are cheap and easy to synthesize. Additionally, the structure of perovskites allows for a wide range of substituting and doping, allowing to tailor their properties to better target applications \cite{royer2014perovskites}.
\section{Objectives}
I will be using VASP to compute surface energies of perovskites, first using DFT and then  potentially using wavefuntion-based methods like HF/MP2. I will compare my results to experimental data from the literature.
\section{Method}
\subsection{Find experimental data for comparison}
Look through Materials Project?
\subsubsection{Choice of perovskite}
I want to compute surface energies for the La series of perovskites; starting with LaMnO3, LaFeO3, and LaCoO3. I think this would be interesting because the transition metal cation is changing across the series, and I would like to see how this affects the surface energies.
\subsection{Perform DFT calculations}
\subsubsection{Choice of DFT functional}
PBE-D3
\subsubsection{Basis choice}
some kind of plane wave bases, tbd
\subsubsection{Choice of k-point mesh}
Can charles suggest something?
\subsection{Perform HF/MP2 or hybrid-DFT calculations}
I was speaking with Charles and we agreed that this might be a good continuation into Ch121b, where I will start on DFT now in Ch121a, and then move on to HF in Ch121b.
