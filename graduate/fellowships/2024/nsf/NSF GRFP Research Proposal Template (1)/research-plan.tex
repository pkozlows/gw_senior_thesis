The proposed plan for the research project you are describing.
Here is some math:
\begin{align*}
    R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu\nu}.  
\end{align*}
\note{This is a note to myself about something to do later.} 
And here is an example citation \cite{paper1}.
Let's cite another paper because we're good scientists \cite{paper2}.
